                            a new perspective on what it means to be a thought leader and how to position 
                            yourself.<br />
                            <br />
                            2. You&#39;ll work with us 1:1 on a narrative review session in order to determine the 
                            story arc that best positions your strengths and unique professional offering.<br />
                            <br />
                            3. You&#39;ll finish the week having used our materials to complete a personal branding 
                            statement that will guide your thought leadership.

                            <br />
                            2. Review best practice instructions on different types of social media channels.<br />
                            <br />
                            3. Meet your accountability partner. Set up a consistent bi-weekly meeting schedule and go 
                            over your initial game plan.

                            <br />
                            2. You and your accountability partner will review what you&#39;ve published and provide 
                            constructive feedback. You&#39;ll go over what your goals were in publishing these pieces 
                            and how they fit with your narrative and assess whether or not things hit the mark and 
                            where they can be further iterated upon.

                            engaging content into the world as the first step in a continuing plan.<br />
                            <br />

                            <br />
                            3. Time to start your next batch of content—made easier because it&#39;s all part of a 
                            plan and consistent story arc.<br />
                            <br />
                            4. Check in with your professional accountability partner to stay up to date with your goals, get 
                            some encouragement, and share what&#39;s working and not working.

                            <br />
                            2. Review and iterate on your voice to focus on how you can improve the clarity and authenticity 
                            of your message, while being more efficient about your content production.<br />
                            <br />
                            3. Continue to publish while focusing on engaging your audience. We&#39;ll provide tips and best practices 
                            on bringing your audience into your writing process and making them feel part of a community around your work.

                            1. Focus on your continuity plan. You&#39;ve seeded your profiles and platforms with content as part of a focused effort, but 
                            how can you maintain it with sustained effort over time in a way that works for you?<br />
                            <br />
                            2. Start bringing in relevant topics that are more “of the moment”. What&#39;s been going on in your space that you want to weigh in on?<br />
                            <br />
                            3. If you&#39;ve consistently published through this point, you&#39;ll get a live interview on our personal branding podcast—which you&#39;ll be 
                            able to use as content for your audience as well.

                        <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ceonyc/" target="_blank">Charlie</a> had a 22 year career in venture capital and built his firm, 
                        <a href="https://www.brooklynbridge.vc/" target="_blank">Brooklyn Bridge Ventures</a>, around content and community. 
                        He developed a reputation as the most accessible investor in New York City particularly through his thought leadership 
                        and willingness to publicly share his insight, advice and best practices. His blog turned newsletter, 
                        <a href="https://www.thisisgoingtobebig.com/" target="_blank">This is Going to Be Big</a>, 
                        was one of the first venture capital blogs and became one of the most widely read. He taught personal brand development 
                        in entrepreneurship courses at Fordham University and NYU Poly, as well as at General Assembly. His online presence has 
                        provided him with opportunities to speak at Techcrunch Disrupt, SXSW and invitations to coach founders in Austria, Chile, 
                        and Colombia. Recently, he announced his departure from investing and focus on new projects and coaching both founders and 
                        investors.<br />

                        broadening her expertise to the Direct to Consumer world. Her transition was made possible through her widely acclaimed newsletter, 
                        <a href="https://ajasinger.substack.com/" target="_blank">For the Love</a>, 
                        which garnered thousands of readers and led her to several consulting engagements—all in a matter of months. She is a creative 
                        problem-solver passionate about the intersection of technology and design and a lifelong learner currently most excited to bring 
                        her years of experience as a founder and creative to web development.<br />
